# PwC HR Diversity and Inclusion Report
## Project Objective
This project is part of a Job Simulation Program by PwC Switzerland, focused on addressing real-world business challenges in diversity and inclusion. The task involved analyzing HR data to uncover insights about gender balance at the executive management level and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard. By tackling KPIs related to promotions, workforce diversity, and leaver trends, this simulation improved my technical, analytical, and visualization skills, preparing me for a career in business intelligence and HR analytics.

## Approach and Execution
Step 1: Data Preparation
- Checked tables for duplicate entries and ensured data accuracy across all records.
- Left blanks in specific columns (e.g., "Leaver FY," "Job Level After FY21 Promotions") to signify "no changes made" rather than imputing values, preserving the integrity of the dataset.
- Ensured consistent formatting and structure for columns such as dates, numeric values, and text fields.

Step 2: Data Transformation
- Transformed data in Power Query, focusing on cleaning and reshaping the dataset to facilitate analysis.
- Validated data types for columns such as dates, numeric values, and text fields to ensure accuracy during the transformation process.
- Created new measures and calculated columns using DAX functions such as DIVIDE, CALCULATE, DISTINCTCOUNT, AVERAGEX, and FILTER.

Step 3: Visualization and Dashboard Creation
- Designed visualizations to highlight key metrics, such as the percentage of female executives, promotion trends, and diversity distributions across departments.
- Incorporated Slicers for interactive filtering by Department, Age Group, and Job Level, enabling a tailored analysis for stakeholders.
- Focused on creating user-friendly visuals to effectively communicate actionable insights related to diversity and inclusion challenges.

## Insights and Conclusion
- This project enhanced my understanding of diversity and inclusion metrics, highlighting their critical role in workforce planning and strategy.
- I gained experience developing KPIs and creating dashboards that provide actionable insights, a vital skill for supporting data-driven decision-making
- The skills and insights from this project are directly applicable to roles involving HR analytics, diversity strategies, and workforce planning.
